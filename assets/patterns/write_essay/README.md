# Write Essay

A quick note about this particular pattern, and the fact that it uses Paul Graham as an example.

This should be used as a tool to help you think and formulate your thoughts, not to (sort of) plagiarize Paul Graham.

To be clear, a lot of people probably already copy his style, and that should be considered a compliment. But please don't use this to go pumping out "your own" content in Graham's voice.

The way to use this is to make your own version of `write_essay`, under your own username within this directory, and put in your own voice, with your own example. Or to do that in a generic way like, "Write a dry and precise technical paper about", etc.

Again, this should show you the power of using patterns in this way, but please don't abuse it.
